Elastic Compute Cloud 101:
	-Virtual machine on the cloud that provides resizable compute capacity. Scaling capacity both up and down as your computing requirements change.
	-EC2 Options:
		-On Demand: Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour(or by second) with NO commitment
		-Reserved(Contract based): Gives you with capacity reservation and offers significant discount on the hourly charge. Steady state and reserved capacity
		-Spot(like stock market): Rates goes up and down gives you even greater savings if your app have flexible start and end times.
		-Dedicated Hosts(No sharing of servers, for eg gov applications): Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Can help you reduce the costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses
	-EC2 Instance Types:
		-D for Density
		-R for Ram
		-M for Main choice for General purpose apps
		-C for Compute
		-G for Graphics
		-I for IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)
		-F for FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays)
		-T for cheap general purpose
		-P for Graphics(think pics)
		-X for Extreme Memory 

	-EBS:
		-Block based storage volumes and attache them to the AMZ EC2 instances. Once attached you can create file system, run DB and OS on these volumes.
		-EBS Volume types
			-General Purpose SSD(GP2)
				-Balance both price and Performance
				-Ration of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10K IOPS and the ability to burst upto 3K IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334 GiB and above
			-Provisioned IOPS SSD(IO1)
				-IO intensive applications such as DB or No sql db.
				-Use if 10K IOPS or more
				-Can provision upto 20K IOPS per volumne
			-Throughput Optimized HHD(ST1) magnetic stroage type
				-BigData
				-DW
				-Log Processing
				-Cannot be boot volumes
			-Cold HDD(SC1)
				-Low cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
				-File server
				-No boot volumes
			-Magnetic (Standrad)
				-Lowest cost per gigabytes of all EBS volume types thats bootable.
				-Ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently
	-EC2 Monitor Settings
		-Basic Monitoring: pinging the syste every 5 min (by default)
		-Detailed Monitoring: pinging the system every 1 min (costs little bit extra)
