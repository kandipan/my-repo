Identity Access Management:
	-IAM: Used to manage users and their access to AWS console
		-Centralised control
		-Shared Access
		-Granular Permission
		-Identity Federation(Facebook, Linkedin etc)
		-Multifactor Authentication
		-Provide temporary access for users/devices and services
		-Setup Password rotation policy
		-Integrates with different AWS services
		-Supports PCI DSS compliance

-Manage User & Group
	-AccessKeyId & SecretAccessKey can be used for programmatically(commandline or APIs) reasons. To access AWS console use the UserName and Password.

S3 101:
	-Safe place to store your files
	-Object based storage(videos, photos, doc, pdf, flat files)
	-Block based storage(DB, OS)
	-Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
	-Bucket(folder) is where the files are stored, bucket names are unquiue globally as its in Universal namespace(Url for bucketName - s3.regionName.amazonaws.com/bucketName)
	-Data Consistency Model
		-Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
		-Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(can take some time to propagate as it span into multiple facilities)
	-S3 objects are Simple Key-Value store
		-Key: Name of the object
		-Value: Data being stored
		-VersionId
		-Metadata (Data about data like file info)
		-Subresources: Exists underneath the object
			-Access Control list
			-Torrent Support (Bit Torrent protocol)
	-Lifecycle Management
	-S3 99.99% availability
	-11X9's durability for S3 information
	-S3-IA: Infrequently Accessed (accessed very rarely)
	- SA - One Zone
	-Glacier: Very cheap for archival only, it takes 3-5 hours to restore
	-Reduce Redundancy Storage: Data that's easily reproducible such as thumb nail etc.
		-RRS Availability: 99.99%
		-RRS Durability: 99.99%
	-Charged for
		-Storage
		-No.Of.Request
		-Storage management pricing
		-Data Transfer Pricing(incoming is free, but will be charged for moving around)
		-Transfer Acceleration
	-Exam tip - Read S3 FAQ
	-S3 - Crosss Region Replication 
		-Versioning must be enabled
		-Regions must be unique
		-Files in the existing bucket are not replicated automatically, all subsequent or future updates will be replicated.
		-Delete markers are replicated 
		-Deleting individual versions are not replicated
	-S3 - Lifecycle Management Lab
		-Can be used in conjuction with Versioning
		-Applied to both current & previous versions
		-Transition to Standard-IA storage classwith minimum 128Kb and 30day after creation date
		-Archive to Glacier storage class with configured no.of.days after IA.

Snowballs:
	Onboard storage with 50 TB or 80TB
	256-bit encryption
	Trusted Platform Module (TPM) - Designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of data

Snowball Edge:
	-Onboard storage with 100TB with compute capability(mini version of AWS in a box)
Snowball Mobile
	-100PB in a container driven by a semi trailor, currently only available in US.
S3 Storage Acceleration:
	-It cost little extra first copy to edge location closer to your region and then moved into S3 bucket	
Static Website Hosting:
	-URL pattern (bucketName.S3-website-REGION_NAME.amazonaws.com)	
	-Severless website
	-Static only files
